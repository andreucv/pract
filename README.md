# pract
Repo of a pract with Django

This is a Django project for a subject in my degree which consists in a issues-tickets solution center.

Users could be clients, support technics or solving problems engineers.
They post tickets. The tickets are assigning automatically and could have a title and a description.
Also members in tickets (owners and assigned technics) can comment and take a conversation through them.

Is a multi-language platform.
Only http requests. There is not more than 15 lines of JS code. 
Almost is there for coloring support tickets depending on its priority with Angular JS.
